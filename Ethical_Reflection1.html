<p=style="color: rgb(38, 38, 34)" >   The article presents the idea that algorithms created to help predict future crimes are largely racially based ,and that the types of crimes committed did not really have a huge effect on the probability of the incarceration of an individual. One example given in the ProPublica article is, and the most suspicious part is that the company that makes these statistical calculations does not disclose how it makes these assessments, leaving much to the imagination. One reason why algorithms are used is the idea of pure, unbiased justice. A computer cannot be racist, yet it also canâ€™t have empathy, which is a huge reason why the idea of computers deciding the fates of humans is so polarizing. Personally, I believe that the algorithm was made with good intentions, yet it reflects the true state of the justice system. While it can be accurate at times in predicting whether or not a person will commit another felony,  I believe that through proper change and action, as well as education, these issues of bias and race can become much less rampant, and the proper people can be properly incarcerated. In my opinion, this is pretty immoral but can be used in a way not to predict crime, but rather to prescribe help, which I believe would benefit everyone in the end.</p>

  <p=style="color: rgb(38, 38, 34)">Another article relating to this, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607955/inspecting-algorithms-for-bias/">The MIT Technology Review</a>, provides insight as to why the scores are so racially skewed, and it could very well be because of the idea of generalized statistics, and that every different situation will be very different.</p>

  <p=style="color: rgb(38, 38, 34)">From this information from these two stories, the main conclusion that I come to is that the algorithms need to be further developed, account for more factors, and needs to include more flexibility in order to be properly enforced in order to apply justice, whether it's rating someone as a low-risk threat, or somebody as a future serial killer. While others find the idea of using any machines quite unethical, I believe that it can be both fair and helpful if applied correctly. </p>
